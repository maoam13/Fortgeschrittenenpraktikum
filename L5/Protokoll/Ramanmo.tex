\section{Impact of the Laser wavelength}
The encapsulated graphene is used to analyze the impact of the Laser wavelength on the Raman spectrum. The $\omega_g$ vs. $\omega_{2D}$ map and $\Gamma_g$ vs. $\Gamma_{2D}$map are shown in figure \ref{fig:Laser_omega} for both Lasers. The distribution of the individual positions are also shown in figure \ref{fig:Laser_omega_hist}.\\
The $\omega_g$ position is not shifted at all. However the $\omega_{2D}$ position shifted from an average position of \SI{2719(3)}{cm^{-1}} for the blue laser to \SI{2683(3)}{cm^{-1}} for the green laser. The reason for this is that only a single electron/hole site participates in the Raman process that leads to the G-line. By changing the Laser frequency only the excitation energy changes. The Raman shift stays the same. The 2D-line requires two lattice sites and the phonon modes connect them. Changing the excitation energy also changes the phonon modes and with that the Raman shift.\\
The higher energy of the blue laser also shifts the average FWHM, as seen in figure \ref{fig:Laser_gamma_hist}. $\Gamma_g$ is larger on average for the blue laser, while $\Gamma_{2D}$ is smaller compared to the green laser. In general the measurement taken with the blue laser seems to be broadly distributed. However this is most likely a consequence of different measurement settings.\\

\section{Polycrytalline Cu sample}
This sample is used to analyze the strain of CVD graphene on on a Cu-substrate for different lattice orientations. The Raman-measurement is done with the blue laser.\\ In a first step the $\omega_{g/2D}$ positions for pristine graphene when using this laser are determined and used as reference for the strain calculation. The spectrum of pristine graphene is shown in figure \ref{fig:pristine}. Both lines have a very low intensity, which indicates that there was no graphene at the point where the spectrum was taken. The 2D-line can be analyzed, which results in  $\omega_{2D} = \SI{2721.1(4)}{cm^{-1}}$. However the G-line intensity is too small to be analyzed. Based on the previous chapter we can assume that the G-line does not shift when changing the laser. This means the Raman of this line should be the same as in the spectrum of pristine graphene taken with the green laser, which is shown in figure \ref{fig:pristine_green}. The G-line frequency is $\omega_{G} = \SI{1582.4(3)}{cm^{-1}}$.\\
\\
The polycrystalline sample and the measurement points are shown in figure  \ref{fig:poly_sample} and the extracted line positions in table \ref{tab:part5_pos}. The point were taken on three different lattice orientations. \\
\\
erkl√§rung analysis.........
\\
\\
The results are shown in table \ref{tab:part5_results}. The Measurement point 1, 3 and 6 were taken in an area where the visible oxidization was low. This is reflected in the low doping concentration at these point. Points 2 and 7 were expected to have a high oxidization, which is also reflected in the data.\\
Points 4 and 5 do not reflect the expectation. However it is possible that the sample was moved during measurement so that point 4 was measured at low oxidization and point 5 at high oxidization.\\
It should also be noted that the position of points 1 and 6 in the map in figure \ref{fig:poly_sample} is left of the strain-line. This technically results in negative doping and is most likely a consequence of an inaccurate measurement resulting in a systematical error, which is not analyzed.\\
\\
The strain is directly impacted by the oxidization. Areas with low doping also show low strain, whereas areas with high doping show high strain. In comparison to this the lattice orientation has a very small impact. Because of the potential systematical error it is impossible to determine the lattice orientation which gives the best result.

\section{Continuous Graphene}
The sample of continuous graphene on oxidized copper and the measured points are shown in figure \ref{fig:part7_sample}. In this chapter we want to analyze the defect density of the sample. Defects lead to the formation of different peaks, because the Raman process can involve defect scattering. In order to be able to analyze this the Intensity of the G-line and the D-line, which involves defect scattering, are determined. Both lines are analyzed with the same method used in previous chapters. The spectrums and fits can be seen in figure \ref{fig:part7_spectrum}. The extracted positions and Intensities are listed in table \ref{tab:part7_results}. With the help of the Model from  Cancado et al.\cite{cancado} the average distance between defects $L_D$ can be determined:
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I_D}{I_G} = C_A \dfrac{(r_A^2 - r_s^2)}{(r_A^2 - 2 r_s^2)} (e^{-\pi r_s^2/L_D^2} -e^{-\pi (r_A^2 - r_s^2)/L_D^2})
\end{equation}
$C_A = 160 * E_L^{-4}$ with the laser energy $E_L = \SI{2.33}{eV}$, $r_s = \SI{1}{nm}$, $r_A = \SI{3.1}{nm}$ are used.\\
This function and the Intensity ratios of the measurement points are shown in figure \ref{fig:part7_fit}. $L_D$ and its error are visually estimated. This results in a average distance of $L_D = \SI{24(1)}{nm}$ for point 1 and $L_D = \SI{70(1)}{nm}$ for point 2.
