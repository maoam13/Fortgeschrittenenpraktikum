use references and images from literature when it helps explain what you’re trying to show. 
Snipping tool is fine to get the literature image. Also use tables to help with organizing the single spectrum data. 

1-3) Discuss about what we did, exfoliation, what we saw with our samples, how many layers, and describe the 
wrinkle that sticking up. What else do we see in the spectra?

4) Describe what you see in the 2D map provided. Extract gamma and omega G and 2D values for the different single 
spectra. 

1-5) It should be possible to make a map of Omega 2D vs G using the extracted values from the single spectra. 
Compare points for encapsulated Gr, Gr on thick hBN, Gr on thin hBN, Gr on PMMA, Gr on SiO2. It should also be 
possible to plot Gamma 2D vs G. You can also calculate the Strain and doping for these points. 

5) Discuss the maps from the encapsulated graphene using the blue and green laser. Use the histograms to help with 
describing the difference. Extract the omegaG/2D position for pristine Graphene with the blue laser to use in later 
calculations

6) Discuss the polycrystalline Cu sample and CVD graphene. Discuss whether the same analysis works on the Cu 
substrates as for SiO2. Calculate the strain shift on the different grains. You can use the easy equation for and 
using the difference from the pristine spectra taken with the blue laser and the encapsulated sample. 

7) For the continuous graphene, calculate the Defect density.
